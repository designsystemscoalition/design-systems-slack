### Welcome!

The purpose of the Design Systems Slack to promote the discussion of design
systems, style guides, component libraries, and pattern libraries.

The Design Systems Slack is dedicated to providing a welcoming environment for
everyone and expects participants in this community to act in a way that
promotes an environment that is harassment-free, safe, comfortable, and
enjoyable to be a part of. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any
form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

#### Admins
The current admins (and their Design Systems Slack handles) are:

* Jina Anne - @jina
* Maya Benari - @maya
* Nathan Curtis - @nathanacurtis
* Mina Markham — @mina
* Donnie D'Amato
* Kaelig Deloumeau-Prigent — @kaelig


### What we strive for

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that encourages people to
have discussions about design systems. Our atmosphere requires an open exchange
of ideas balanced by thoughtful guidelines. It would be impossible to list
everything needed to create a more welcoming space, but we encourage you to
embrace these principles for guidance:

* Be humble; practice empathy and humility.
* Assume competence in each other.
* Listen carefully and actively.
* Ask questions, and seek to understand each other's context.
* Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
* Respect each others time by doing research before asking questions that have
  been addressed before or in other channels.
* Be open and honest about your intentions (particularly important for those
  sharing resources).

### Unacceptable behavior

To help participants understand behaviors that are unacceptable or run counter
to our culture, we’ve listed below actions that violate our Code of Conduct
policy.

This list does not cover every case. Each person you interact with is unique,
and as a result can define a line of unacceptable behavior that’s unique to
them. Ensuring that your behavior does not have a negative impact is your
responsibility.

#### Harassment includes:

* Negative or offensive remarks based on race, religion, color, sex (with or
without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving
transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age,
disability, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
expression, parental status, marital status, political affiliation, mental
illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical
appearance, body size, or clothing.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior
* Unwelcome sexual attention or remarks
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person
  to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Constant private messaging to pick people’s brains rather than having open
  conversations in public channels
* Publication of non-harassing private communication
* Intentionally or repeatedly referring to people in a way that rejects the
  validity of their gender identity; for instance, by using incorrect pronouns
  or forms of address (misgendering).
* Microaggressions, which are small comments or questions, either intentional or
  unintentional, that marginalize people by communicating hostile, derogatory,
  or negative beliefs. Examples include:
  * Patronizing language or behavior
    * Pedantic corrections that don’t contribute to the conversation (For
      example: “Well actually’s…")
    * Assuming without asking that particular people or groups need concepts
      defined or explained to them. (It’s great to be sensitive to the fact that
      people may not be familiar with technical terms you use every day. But
      assuming that people are uninformed can come across as patronizing.)
    * Assuming that particular groups of people are technically unskilled ("So
      easy your grandmother could do it.")
  * Repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else
  * Feigning surprise at someone’s lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic
  * The use of racially charged language to describe an individual or thing such
    as "thug" or “ghetto”
  * Referring to an individual in a way that demeans or challenges the validity
    of their racial identity
  * Mocking someone’s real or perceived accent or first language.
* Retaliating against anyone who files a complaint that someone has violated
  this code of conduct.

#### Open & Honest Sharing

When it comes to sharing resources, please be open and honest about any costs
associated with using the resource. If there is a price, or if there is a sign
up form (which comes at a cost at providing personal information), then that
needs to be made very clear when announcing.

### Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact the [admins](#admins) by sending them a
direct message. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

The admins will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom
we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about
them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

### Consequences

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate or harassing behavior must comply
immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action
they deem appropriate, including warning the offender and up to and including
expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone
about whom we've received complaints.

### Message retention

Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but
Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages
back to the creation of Design Systems Slack. Slack is a U.S. company and
therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to
subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.

### Privacy

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**.
This is a public slack. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing
sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.
